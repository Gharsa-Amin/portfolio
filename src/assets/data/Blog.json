        "content": "<p>Having spent the majority of my career in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, I have a deeper love and connection to this space. In the coming years, we might see more applications of these technologies in real-world scenarios, from secure data transactions to more powerful computing systems.</p> <p>I was deeply frustrated as a compliance officer and as an investigator to see how loopholes within the blockchain systems exposed our elderly population and our kids to higher risk (cyber, fraud, romance scams). I was deeply frustrated how networks were shutting down when more users wanted to execute trades, or use the blockchain infrastructure. Blockchains currently have fundamental issues: Constantly getting targeted with cyber-threats. Inherent vulnerabilities exist within smart contracts, and the Defi space. Many blockchains face scalability issues. The blockchain trilemma where the difficulty of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability all at once is not possible. Interoperability is a very big issue, where hundreds of blockchain networks exist, but they often can't communicate with one another. I am planning to address interoperability, scalability and cyber-security related issues when it comes to blockchain technologies. Using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for hedging against cyber-security related threats/vulnerability of smart contracts, while generating randomness within the blockchain cryptography hashing is needed.</p> <p>Main issues I found within the blockchain technology: </p> <p>1): Blockchain technologies are not scalable enough for mass-adoption. I have worked with 6 startups which had a focus on blockchain technologies, and have gained hands-on experience that blockchain scalability is a big concern for everyone involved. Interoperability, where different blockchains interact with each other is a big problem, a problem that has not been addressed yet to the extent needed, and I want to tackle this issue.</p> <p>2): More than 80% of the people in the blockchain space, based on my personal interactions think that quantum is too far away, and they do not think about the intersection of quantum and blockchain.</p> <p>3): I think quantum needs to be more accessible to entrepreneurs for accessibility, integration and learning purposes. This is the main reason I want to enter into the quantum space as an entrepreneur, from a practical standpoint, where the focus is on creating/disrupting/shipping products rather than on research, and academia which could lead to quantum becoming more relevant to the day-to-day workflow.</p> <p>More people getting onboarded to the blockchain eco-system also means more data, more transactions. On-chain doesnâ€™t have the capacity to take over all this data and still function, and not face outages. What I am interested in to explore is the intersection of quantum and blockchain and how these two fields can support each other. </p><p>Some Basic Quantum terms:</p> <p>Quantum algorithms: A quantum algorithm is an algorithm that can be executed on a quantum computer or the simulation of a quantum computer. Quantum algorithms use fundamental properties of quantum mechanics , such as superposition , interference and quantum entanglement . The model for the quantum computer is usually a quantum circuit consisting of qubits , quantum gates and quantum mechanical measurements . The model for the quantum computer is usually a quantum circuit . A quantum circuit uses qubits instead of bits . The state of a quantum bit is represented by a normalized state vector with the two components. Several qubits are combined to form a quantum register . Quantum entanglement is when two particles link together in a certain way no matter how far apart they are in space . When two particles become entangled, they can instantly affect each other's properties, no matter the distance between them. Entanglement is the backbone of quantum computing. It's what enables quantum bits, or qubits, to perform complex calculations at incredible speeds</p> <p>This was an introduction to understand the quantum and blockchain space better. We will be diving deeper moving forward.!</p>"
